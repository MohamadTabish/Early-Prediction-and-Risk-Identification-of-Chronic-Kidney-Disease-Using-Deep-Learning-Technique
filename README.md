Early Prediction and Risk Identification of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on the early prediction and risk identification of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using advanced deep learning techniques. CKD is a progressive condition that affects kidney function and, if not detected early, can lead to severe complications, including kidney failure. The goal of this research is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning model to predict CKD in its early stages, allowing for timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.

Key Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a deep neural network (DNN) to analyze complex patterns in patient data for accurate CKD prediction. The model is trained on a large dataset containing medical and clinical records of individuals, focusing on early indicators of CKD.

Feature Engineering: Medical parameters such as blood pressure, glucose levels, albumin, hemoglobin, and other biomarkers are used to enhance the model's predictive power.

Risk Identification: The system not only predicts CKD but also identifies key risk factors contributing to the likelihood of disease progression, aiding in personalized healthcare recommendations.

Early Detection: With a focus on early-stage identification, the model can assist healthcare professionals in initiating treatments that can delay or even prevent the onset of advanced CKD stages.
