# Early-Prediction-and-Risk-Identification-of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Using-Deep-Learning-Technique
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based model for the early prediction and risk identification of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). CKD is a progressive condition that impairs kidney function and can lead to severe complications, including kidney failure, if not diagnosed in its early stages.
